# SteadyCoding
## Introduction
Welcome to steadyCoding, this my personal iniative to share my coding skills with my Ugandan firends. My motivation stems off from a conversation I heard with one friend about how schools in Uganda have been in lockdown due to covid-19 for over five months. I thought this woud be a great time t share some of my coding skills with my peers back home.
Welcome aboard, everyone!
## Goals
The goals of this project are simple:
1. steadily introduce you to what coding is through an introduction to web development
1. Enable you contribute to larger project through the opensource Odin Project web development course that we will be using
1. Spark off an interest to learn more and share with other Ugandans

## Expectations
I recently found a great open source tool called The Odin project that has an easy explanaton of web development concepts.
This will be our primary resource for our sessions.


- For the introduction, we will concetrate on front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- My dream is to expand to back-end web development, and eventually build steady full-stack web developers.
- We will organizeone-hour meetings weekly to discuss key take aways from our week's assignments and present the projects we will have completed for that week.

* Note: I will also be learning along with everyone, so we will all be resources to eavh other! *

Together, we will enjoy the ride, steady and coding!

## Resources
I understand that not everyone is able to access internet all the time and that is my motivation to have less of the synchronous meetings.
Our primary resource for this class is the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). Although it is not require, i highly recommend setting up an account with The Odin project to keep track of your progress.
In addition to the weekly meetings, I will be available for extra support by email, slack, or another communication channel.

## Plan
During this program, we will concetrate on some of the web development sections on [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home), although to is recommended to look through the other sections too
